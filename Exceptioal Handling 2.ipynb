    "The \"try-except\" block, also known as exception handling, is a construct in programming languages that allows you to handle and recover from errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. The main role of the try-except block is to provide a mechanism for gracefully handling and responding to errors, preventing the program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within the \"try\" block is executed. This is the section where you anticipate potential errors or exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception occurs within the \"try\" block, the execution is immediately transferred to the corresponding \"except\" block. The \"except\" block contains code that specifies how to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within the \"except\" block is executed, allowing you to handle the exception appropriately. You can log the error, display a meaningful error message to the user, or take other necessary actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using try-except blocks, you can gracefully handle exceptions and control the flow of your program even when unexpected errors occur. This helps in writing robust and fault-tolerant code. It's important to note that you can have multiple \"except\" blocks to handle different types of exceptions, allowing you to tailor the error handling based on specific situations."
